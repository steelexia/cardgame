/** 
 While Ability class represents raw abilities that are used for calculations and such, AbilityWrapper is used for representing the actual specific abilities that exists in the game. This presents a list of abilities users can choose from, and would not include the large number of abilities that does not make any sense.
 This class makes it much easier to send ability data, as one number would represent a combination of settings (castType, durationType, etc.). Use this for all store and similar purposes.
 Note that this really is only a convenience class, as it's impossible to manage the almost infinitely many combinations Ability can have. For example, OP single player abilities can be added directly with Ability without needing to use this at all.
 There is also no ID number stored for each AbilityWrapper. Instead its index to the allAbilities array is used as the ID.
